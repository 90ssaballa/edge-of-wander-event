---UPDATE 7/23/23---
I was able to finally get the code working! I updated the html and then reviewed the course on the DOM events. After these and a lot of googling, I found the solution to the issue. Feeling so accomplished :)

---UPDATE 7/22/23---
I got a feedback that it would be nice to have the modal window closed when the Escape button is pressed or the outside of the modal window is clicked. I was able to work on closing the video when Escape is pressed, however, in need of help with closing the video when outside of the modal is clicked.


Welcome to the  Edge of Wander event repository!
This project was to challenge myself in building a web page using the tools I have and what I have learned so far in The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery course- html, css, and some javascript.

I based this page on the layout master project file of the course. I wanted to make it a simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly event page.

The biggest challenge for me making this page was getting too focused on how it would look rather than structuring what I would put on the page. 
I was constantly making changes to the design, color, and font size of the headline. I realized that I didn't have a structure so I mapped out a sketch of the design concept. I need a buy ticket button, a place to put to poster and event details, the album, and a button to show the video trailer.
From there, I focused on completing the html structure and then the css.

I wrote the script inline with the html code as the concept was still new to me. I had to google javascript and find how to open links and show a countdown timer. There's still a lot for me to learn and I'm glad that the javascript on my page are working.  

I would greatly appreciate feedback to improve this page. :)

This was a fun project! It helped me understand the concepts I learned and be able to apply it.
Thank y'all!
