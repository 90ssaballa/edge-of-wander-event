# edge-of-wander-event

👋Hi everyone! I made my first real life project! 🎉

After learning some HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript through a ZTM course and other online resources, I took on a challenge to build an event page for my brother. 
He wanted it to be simple but I wasn't confident of what I'm capable of doing with the current knowledge I have with building a website. I was hesistant but I also wanted to keep on learning so I took on the challenge. 

<ul>
  <li>✅ build a website using HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>✅ added the ability to open a modal to play the trailer video and an event day countdown on top of the header using Javascript</li>
  <li>✅ develop locally in the computer using Sublime Text</li>
  <li>✅ deploy website to the web using Github pages</li>
  <li>✅ bought custom domain name and point it to Github pages - www.edgeofwander2023.com </li>
</ul>

I tried to make it a simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly event page. But with the current knowledge I had, I've ran into many challenges and obstacles. 😦
😓 Challenges: There's a lot I didn't know and have yet to learn. Building the page from "scratch" was very challenging but I was learning as I was building it which felt amazing! The idea was simple, but as simple as it is to say it was actually really hard. 😞

Working on this project, I began to learn and understand more of the many concepts such as HTML semantic elements, centering the div, use of flexbox, and accessibility. I also learned how to document better and put comments not only in HTML and CSS stylesheet but also in the script as well. This would allow other people reading the code to understand it too.


💻 Resources: There's a lot of great resources online that helped me build the event page. I utilized the google search and YouTube quite a LOT. Among those resources that greatly helped me were W3schools, stackoverflow, some blog posts! I also got feedback and additional resources from awesome people I met in the ZTM and Scrimba discord communities.

There's been a lot of updates I made as I learned new concepts and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. This was the first challenge and always down for more challenges. I had fun with this project and this really helped me understand how to build a website a little more. 👊

I'd appreciate anyone who would be kind to review my code and learn from it so I can improve on my skills 🙏

Thank you and Happy coding! SARAH 🍵

--UPDATE 7/22/23---
I got a feedback that it would be nice to have the modal window closed when the Escape button is pressed or the outside of the modal window is clicked. Using online resources, I looked up and learned more about how to build a modal window and using Javascript to make the modal open. I was able to work on closing the video when Escape is pressed, however, in need of help with closing the video when outside of the modal is clicked.

---UPDATE 7/23/23---
I was able to finally get the code working! I updated the html and then reviewed DOM events. After these and a lot of googling, I found the solution to the issue. Feeling so accomplished :)

---UPDATE 8/2/2023---
I received a feedback from someone on my code! I appreciated this person took the time to review and give me feedback. I learned more about HTML semantic elements, and made changes on my HTML structure. I was also provided a resource on when to use var vs let vs const when declaring variables.
