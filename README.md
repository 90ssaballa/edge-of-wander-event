# edge-of-wander-event
Welcome to the  Edge of Wander event repository!
This project was to challenge myself in buiding a web page using the tools I have and what I have learned so far in The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery course- html, css, and some javascript.

I based this page on the layout master project file of the course. I customized it to make it simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly.
This was a fun little project. It helped me understand the concepts I learned from the course and be able to apply it.

I would greatly appreciate feedback to improve this page.
