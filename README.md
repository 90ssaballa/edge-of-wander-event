# edge-of-wander-event

👋Hi everyone! I made my first real life project! 🎉

After learning the some HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript through a ZTM course and other online resources, I took on a challenge to build an event page for my brother. 
He wanted it to be simple but I wasn't confident of what I'm capable of doing with the current knowledge I have with building a website. I wanted to keep on learning so I took on the challenge. 

<ul>
  <li>✅ build a website using HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>✅ added the ability to open a modal to play the trailer video and an event day countdown on top of the header using Javascript</li>
  <li>✅ develop locally in the computer using Sublime Text</li>
  <li>✅ deploy website to the web using Github pages</li>
  <li>✅ bought custom domain name and point it to Github pages - www.edgeofwander2023.com </li>
</ul>

I tried to make it a simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly event page. But with the current knowledge I had, I've ran into many challenges and obstacles. 😦
😓 Challenges: There's a lot I didn't know and have yet to learn. Building the page from "scratch" was very challenging but I was learning as I was building it which felt amazing! The idea was simple but as simple as to say it was really hard to actually do it. I began to learn and understand more of the many concepts such as HTML semantic elements, centering the div, use of flexbox, and accessibility. I also had struggled a lot with using Javascript. It wasn't easy to understand when I was learning but during the process of building this page helped me to make sense how to declare a function and stru

💻 Resources: There's a lot of great resources online that helped me build the event page. I utilized the google search and YouTube quite a LOT. Among those resources that greatly helped me were W3schools, stackoverflow, some blod great blog posts! I also got feedback and additional resources from awesome people I met in the ZTM and Scrimba discord communities.

There's been a lot of updates I made as I learned new concepts and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. This was the first challenge and always down for more challenges. I had fun with this project and this really helped me understand how to build a website a little more. 👊

I'd appreciate anyone who would be kind to review my code and learn from it so I can improve on my skills 🙏

Thank you and Happy coding! SARAH 🍵
