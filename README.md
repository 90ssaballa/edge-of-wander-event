# edge-of-wander-event
Welcome to the  Edge of Wander event repository!
This project was to challenge myself in buiding a web page using the tools I have and what I have learned so far in The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery course- html, css, and some javascript.

I based this page on the layout master project file of the course. I customized it to make it simple and responsive with a mobile-first approach to ensure optimal user experience across devices. 
I would greatly appreciate feedback to improve this page.
