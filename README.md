# edge-of-wander-event

👋Hi everyone! I made my first real life project! 🎉

After learning some HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript through a ZTM course and other online resources, I took on a challenge to build an event page for my brother. 
He wanted it to be simple but I wasn't confident of what I'm capable of doing with the current knowledge I have with building a website. I wanted to keep on learning so I took on the challenge. 

<ul>
  <li>✅ build a website using HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>✅ added the ability to open a modal to play the trailer video and an event day countdown on top of the header using Javascript</li>
  <li>✅ develop locally in the computer using Sublime Text</li>
  <li>✅ deploy website to the web using Github pages</li>
  <li>✅ bought custom domain name and point it to Github pages - www.edgeofwander2023.com </li>
</ul>

I tried to make it a simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly event page. But with the current knowledge I had, I've ran into many challenges and obstacles. 😦
😓 Challenges: There's a lot I didn't know and have yet to learn. Building the page from "scratch" was very challenging but I was learning as I was building it which felt amazing! The idea was simple but as simple as it is to say it was actually really hard. It was challenging to design the page but with some of my knowledge with CSS I made the

I also struggled a lot with Javascript.

put comments in your html and CSS stylesheet so that it’s very readable

💻 Resources: There's a lot of great resources online that helped me build the event page. I utilized the google search and YouTube quite a LOT. Among those resources that greatly helped me were W3schools, stackoverflow, some blod great blog posts! I also got feedback and additional resources from awesome people I met in the ZTM and Scrimba discord communities.

There's been a lot of updates I made as I learned new concepts and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. This was the first challenge and always down for more challenges. I had fun with this project and this really helped me understand how to build a website a little more. 👊

I'd appreciate anyone who would be kind to review my code and learn from it so I can improve on my skills 🙏

Thank you and Happy coding! SARAH 🍵
