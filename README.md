# edge-of-wander-event

👋Hi everyone! I made my first real life project! 🎉 [Edge of Wander](www.edgeofwander2023)

After learning some HTML, CSS, and basic Javascript through a ZTM course and other online resources, I took on a challenge to build an event page for my brother. 

<ul>
  <li>✅ build a website using HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>✅ add the ability to open a modal to play the video trailer and an event day countdown on top of the header using Javascript</li>
  <li>✅ develop locally in the computer using Sublime Text</li>
  <li>✅ deploy website to the web using Github pages</li>
  <li>✅ buy custom domain name and point it to Github pages - www.edgeofwander2023.com </li>
</ul>

I tried to make it a simple, responsive, and mobile-friendly event page. But with the current knowledge I had, I've ran into many challenges and obstacles. 😦

😓 Challenges: There's a lot I didn't know and have yet to learn. Building the page from scratch was very challenging but I was learning as I was building it, which felt amazing! The idea was simple, but as simple as it is to say it was actually really hard to build 😞. I got into some sort of problems centering the text elements and making the texts readable in desktop and mobile views. Additionally, I was having trouble making the site responsive. I've had frustrations, but I was enjoying the learning process and was seeing the result so I kept going and pushed through.

💡 Learnings: Working on this project, I began to learn and understand more of the many concepts such as HTML semantic elements, use of flexbox, responsive design, and accessibility. I also learned how to document better and put comments not only in the HTML and CSS stylesheet but also in the script as well. This would allow other people reading the code to understand it too.

💻 Resources: There's a lot of great resources online that helped me build the event page. I utilized the google search and YouTube quite a LOT. Among those resources that greatly helped me were W3schools, stackoverflow, and some blog posts! I also got feedback and additional resources from awesome people I met in the ZTM and Scrimba discord communities.

There's been a lot of updates I made as I learned new concepts, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far. This was the first challenge and will always be down for more challenges. I had fun with this project and this really helped me understand how to build a website a little more. 👊

I'd appreciate anyone who would be kind to review my code for me to learn from it and improve on my skills 🙏

Thank you and Happy coding! SARAH 🍵

--UPDATE 7/22/23---
I got a feedback that it would be nice to have the modal window closed when the Escape button is pressed or the outside of the modal window is clicked. Using online resources, I looked up and learned more about how to build a modal window and how to use Javascript to open the modal window. I was able to work on closing the video when Escape is pressed, however, I still need help with closing the video when outside of the modal is clicked.

---UPDATE 7/23/23---
I was able to finally get the code working! I updated the html and then reviewed DOM events. After these and a lot of googling, I found the solution to the issue. Feeling so accomplished :)

---UPDATE 8/2/2023---
Someone reviewed my code! I appreciated that someone took the time to review my code, and gave me feedback and motivation to keep on learning. I made changes on my HTML structure after learning more about HTML semantic elements. I was also provided a resource on when to use var vs let vs const when declaring variables.
